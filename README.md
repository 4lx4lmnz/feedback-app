# React Feedback App

This project is from the course "React Front To Back 2022". It demonstrates the fundamentals of React by implementing a product/service rating system with CRUD operations on user feedback. This project covers topics such as

- Components
- JSX
- Props (proptypes, defaultprops, etc)
- State (Component & App Level)
- Styling
- Handling Events
- Lists & Keys
- Forms
- Context API

Additionally the branch , **mock-backend**, demonstrates simulated persistent storage using JSON and API HTTP requests using json-server.
